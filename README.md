# Introduction-to-programming-with-MATLAB
These are my solutions to the course assignments for Introduction to programming with MATLAB offered by Vanderbilt University on coursera (link- https://www.coursera.org/course/matlab).

I will be updating the assignment solutions after each week's deadline has passed as the course participants are not allowed to share code publicly.

Please use this only as a reference and do not plagiarise.
